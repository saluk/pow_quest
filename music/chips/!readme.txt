Hi and thanks for downloading or otherwise managing to acquire my little
collection of chiptunes. I'm hukka and hope you will manage to enjoy at least
a fraction of the songs in this collection.

The songs in this collection were made from 1999 to 2008 using either Impulse
Tracker or later Schism Tracker, mostly - a few tunes were made in Linux
using Sound Tracker (no, not THE original Sound Tracker).
Do NOT trust the messages left in the sample names, they're wrong a lot of
the time.

This is by far not a complete collection of chiptunes I've ever made,
but I've only picked a) ones I like the best and b) ones I think are
"important" to me in one way or the other.

A final comment - I heartily recommend using XMplay (unseen.com) to play back
these tunes (either that or IT/Schism Tracker) - steer clear of Winamp if you
want to hear these tunes properly.

Thanks,
hukka
